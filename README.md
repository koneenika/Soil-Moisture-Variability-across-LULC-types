🌍 Soil Moisture Variability Analysis Across LULC Types – Bankura, West Bengal

This project explores how different land use and land cover (LULC) types impact soil moisture variability in the Bankura district of West Bengal using Sentinel-1 SAR data and Landsat-8 imagery.

🛰️ What It Does

Uses Sentinel-1 VV/VH bands for soil moisture analysis.

Classifies LULC from Landsat-8 data using QGIS.

Resamples and aligns datasets to extract moisture values by LULC class.

Calculates average soil moisture for each land class and visualizes results.

Performs ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Pearson correlation to identify statistically significant differences in soil moisture across land types.

📦 Technologies & Tools

Python, Rasterio, NumPy, Matplotlib

QGIS for LULC classification

Data sources: Copernicus Browser & USGS Earth Explorer

📊 Key Outputs

Color-coded LULC and soil moisture maps

Bar chart showing average moisture per land type

Statistical test results confirming variability by land cover

Practical insights into which areas retain or lose moisture

🌱 Practical Use

Supports better land management, irrigation planning, and restoration efforts by identifying areas with high or low soil moisture retention.
